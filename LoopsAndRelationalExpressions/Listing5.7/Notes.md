x++ and ++x are both meant to increment the value of x.
But x++ means use the current value of x for the execution,
after increase the value by 1.
Whereas, ++x means, increase the value of x by 1 after use the
new value of x for the execution.
This rule of use-and-change and change-and-use applies to x-- and
--x as well.
